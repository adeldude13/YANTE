Text Editor
===========
currently this is the most basic text editor to ever exist, nothing special about it, but im going to add a feature everyday to the point where im happy with it

# To build:
```bash
$ make
```
will generate executable with the name main

# Usage:
```bash
$ ./main [file name you want to edit]
```
